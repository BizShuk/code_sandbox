### tools
[check here for document and setup script](https://github.com/BizShuk/env_setup/tree/master/pkg/nodejs)

- **npm**: Node JS package manager
- **Webpack**: 
- **Gulp**: Automation just like Grunt but instead of configurations you can write JavaScript with streams like it's a node application. Much better than Grunt.
- **Express**: Node JS web application framework. Could be used for routing and anything else needed is cover through middle wares. Very popular and beautifully designed so if you want to create a web application project with node, you are probably using it.
- Slush and Yeoman: Project scaffolding systems. You can create starter projects with them. Not good that much, use a Github boilerplate instead.
- **Babel** : transcompiler for ES6 to ES5
